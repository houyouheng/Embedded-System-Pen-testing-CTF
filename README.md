# Embedded-System-Pen-testing-CTF
This project is a open source project by a senior design team at Rose-Hulman Insititute of Technology. Our team aims to develop an embedded system penetration testing (pen-testing) device for Rolls-Royce in order to properly teach security principles to engineers in training and potentially high schoolers or anyone else interested in learning about pen-testing.

The OS files for the system are in the rar file below. To use them you need at least a 64GB SD card for the user device and atleast an 8GB SD card for the server device.
